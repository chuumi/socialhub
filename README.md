# Social Hub

A cute little HTML project I made for myself to keep all my social media links in one place. It is customizable, aesthetic, and fun to personalize with icons and popups. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`) ♡

## What It Does

- Shows a desktop-style layout with clickable icons
- Each icon opens a popup with links to socials like Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Spotify, Twitch — or any others you want to add
- Built using just HTML, CSS, and JS — no frameworks needed

## How to Use

- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Edit the names, usernames, and image files to your own
- Host it online if you want, or just keep it local on your device

## File Structure

```
css/        → styles  
fonts/      → custom fonts  
images/     → profile pics + icons + cursor  
js/         → popup functionality  
media/      → optional music or extras  
index.html  → main file
```

## Optional Hosting

Can be hosted on Netlify, GitHub Pages, or anywhere that supports static files. (★‿★)
